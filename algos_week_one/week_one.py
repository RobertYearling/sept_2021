# Skyline Heights
# Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Letâ€™s say you are
# given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending
# away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below
# street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind
# the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings
# you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always
# with challenges, do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().
